## Exercise 2 (in groups of 1-3): 
### Goal: 
#### write ~2 sentences about what the method does
#### again, make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)
#### list the github usernames of everyone in your group
#### submit a pull request to brainstorm_modified.md

## Dup-Seq
Schmitt, Michael W., Scott R. Kennedy, Jesse J. Salk, Edward J. Fox, Joseph B. Hiatt, and Lawrence A. Loeb. “Detection of Ultra-rare Mutations by Next-generation Sequencing.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 109, no. 36 (September 4, 2012): 14508–14513. doi:10.1073/pnas.1208715109.

Next-generation DNA sequencing has an error rate of approx. 1% which results in many mistakes. The error rate has to be much lower to detect ultra-rare mutations. The authors propose to sequence both strands of a DNA duplex (Duplex Sequencing). True mutations are found on both strands which decreases the error rate drastically. 
 
**Technology**: next-generation DNA sequencing
**Application**: Detection of ultra-rare mutations, i.e. lower the error rate by sequencing both strands
**Statistics**: none (simple error rate calculation)
